> The Trinidad Sour was created by ex-New York City bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez while he was plying his trade at the
> Clover Club in Brooklyn in 2009. The unique serve is a mixture of a whopping one and a half ounces (or one ounce,
> depending on who you ask) of Angostura bitters, balanced with lemon juice, orgeat (a nut syrup) and rye whiskey.
> Gonzalez developed the concept after being inspired by Italian bartender Valentino Bolognese’s competition-winning
> Trinidad Especial, which used lime instead of lemon, and pisco instead of rye.

Angostura bitters clock in around 45% alcohol, so using it as the base of the cocktail is similar to using a whiskey or
rum in terms of alcohol level and potency. The big difference is the intense, bold botanicals of the bitters, the exact
recipe of which is a closely guarded secret. There’s not really a comparable spirit. While some of the more
botanical-heavy, bittersweet amari would be closest, they usually lack the high proof and the intensity.

The bitters are bolstered with a half-ounce of rye whiskey to lend additional spice and structure—whichever rye you
prefer for your Manhattan or Sazerac will fit here nicely. For sweetness, the drink gets an ounce of orgeat rather than
the more familiar simple syrup. This nut-based syrup can sometimes be hard to find on store shelves, but brands like BG
Reynolds, Liber & Co. and even Torani sell bottles of it online. If you want, you can always have a go at making your
own orgeat.

Along with the orgeat, lemon juice helps balance the herbal intensity of the bitters. All together it makes the Trinidad
Sour a rich, singular delight.
