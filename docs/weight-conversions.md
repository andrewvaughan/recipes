# Weight conversions

The following are approximate conversions of volumes to weight for recipes that provide only volumes. Due to
environmental changes, such as humidity, it's possible for these to differ by season and even time of day.

- `†` infers this is a commonly accepted community equivalent.
- `*` infers that this measurement is personally taken from a climate-controlled kitchen around 72ºF and 50% relative humidity.
