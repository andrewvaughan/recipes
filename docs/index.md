# Vaughan family recipes

Welcome to our recipe repository! We use this as a method to share everything from generations-old recipes to new
techniques for cooking, baking, and even making cocktails.

## Favorites

Take a dive into some of my favorite combinations:

### Dinner: [Chicken marsala](cooking/dinner/chicken-marsala-no-mushrooms.md)

While not a "traditional" marsala, as this dish lacks mushrooms, the mix of
[Chicken marsala](cooking/dinner/chicken-marsala-no-mushrooms.md),
[Herb-roasted red potatoes](cooking/sides/herb-roasted-red-potatoes.md), and
[French green beans and shallots](cooking/sides/french-green-beans-and-shallots.md) are extremely impressive, all cook
at the same temperatures and in the same amount of time, so the actual cooking is extremely easy. This is a great dish
for a first-date.

### Lunch: [Epic grilled cheese](cooking/lunch/epic-grilled-cheese.md)

There are some secrets we have uncovered from generations of making grilled cheese that will knock your socks of. Ever
had Granny Smith Apple slices on your grilled cheese before with a layer of apple-wood smoked bacon and some dijon
mustard? Your world is about to be rocked.

### Breakfast: [Andrew's waffles](cooking/breakfast/waffles.md)

Whether making [Pancakes](cooking/breakfast/pancakes.md) or [Waffles](cooking/breakfast/waffles.md), the homemade mix is
nearly identical. The Waffle mix simply has a little extra cornstarch mixed in to keep the waffle crispy on the outside
and gooey in the middle.

Personally, we keep a large container of all the dry ingredients pre-mixed (except the cornstarch), so we can simply
measure out a certain weight of dry ingredients, add a couple eggs, some milk, oil, and vanilla, and quickly mix up
either Pancakes or, if we add a bit of Cornstarch, some tasty waffles.

## And more...

Of course, there's even more to discover. Simply use the menu on the left to browse or the search option to find
