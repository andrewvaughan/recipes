This is a fantastic and easy to make Banana Bread recipe that's my go-to for ripening bananas. It has a mega banana
flavor because of how much banana is in the recipe. Make sure to mash the bananas really well, or you may get banana
chunks in the bread.

Additionally, the sour cream - or yogurt, if you don't have sour cream - is a must-have for a moist cake. We sometimes
use strawberry yogurt for an extra bit of flavor.

Finally, our family actually prefers these more as Banana Muffins than Banana Bread, which there are directions for,
[below](#banana-muffin-alternative).

## Recipe

If using frozen bananas, make sure they thaw thoroughly before starting. You'll want to thaw them in a bowl, as they
usually leak fluid. Dispose of any fluid that comes out of the bananas.

After the last step, just before pouring into the pan, you can also fold in ¾ of a Cup of additional ingredients, such
as:

- Chocolate chips
- Pecans
- Raisins
- Walnuts

### Ingredients

_These ingredients are enough for a single 9x5" loaf pan and can be easily doubled._

## Banana muffin alternative

This recipe makes _excellent_ Banana Muffins - our family actually prefers these over the loaf.

This recipe makes about 15 Banana Muffins. Preheat the oven to 425ºF and follow [Directions](#directions) #3-9, then:

1. Line a muffin pan or two, enough for 15 muffins, with muffin liners
2. Spoon the batter into the pan, filling each to the top
3. Bake for 5-minutes at 425ºF
4. Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 350ºF and bake for an additional 16-17 minutes
5. Check with a toothpick - it should come out clean; if not ready, cook 1-2 minutes more and then check again repeatedly
6. Cool _in the muffin tray_ on a wire rack  for 1-hour
7. Remove muffins from pan and cool directly on wire rack until ready to serve or store
