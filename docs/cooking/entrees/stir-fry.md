# Stir Fry

This is a delicious stir-fry recipe that is extremely easy to make. Once the sauce is made, you can simply chop some
vegetables and protein (which can also be done ahead of time) and have a delicious meal ready in less than 15-minutes!

## Stir-Fry Sauce

This sauce can (and should) be made ahead of time. This allows the flavors to combine. Keep in the refrigerator (we use
a soup container with a screw-on lid).

The ginger will float to the top of the sauce, so a good shake should be used to mix and some effort should be taken to
not pour all the ginger into the wok, when used. Aim to add a couple of tablespoons of ginger to the wok for each meal.

### Sauce Ingredients

_These ingredients will make about 4-cups (32oz) of sauce._

|         Amount         | Ingredient                        |
| :--------------------: | :-------------------------------- |
|        1½ Cups         | Chicken Broth                     |
|         1 Cup          | Soy Sauce                         |
|     6 TBSP (⅜ Cup)     | Honey                             |
|     6 TBSP (⅜ Cup)     | Sesame Oil                        |
| 6 TBSP (⅜ Cup / ~195g) | Ginger, Fresh, Peeled, and Grated |
|  9 Cloves (1.5 TBSP)   | Garlic, Minced                    |
|         3 TBSP         | Cornstarch                        |

Crushed red pepper flakes can also be added to-taste for a kick, but bear in mind that as these soak longer they will
increase the heat of the sauce. In other words, _a little goes a long way_.

Generally, this amount will be enough to create 9-16 servings of stir fry (generally, 3-4 meals for 3-4 people).

### Directions

1. In a bowl, vigorously whisk the **Chicken Broth** with the **Cornstarch** until well-incorporated
2. Mix all ingredients into a sealed jar and shake well
