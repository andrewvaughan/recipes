# Stir fry

This is a delicious stir-fry recipe that's extremely easy to make. Once you make the sauce, you can simply chop some
vegetables and protein, which you can also do ahead of time, and have a delicious meal ready in less than 15-minutes.

## Stir-fry sauce

You can, and should, make this sauce ahead of time. This allows the flavors to combine. Keep the sauce in the
refrigerator. It's recommended to use a soup container, or similar, with a screw-on lid for storage.

The ginger floats to the top of the sauce, so give the sauce a good shake before use to mix. Take some effort to also
not pour all the ginger into the wok, when used. Aim to add a couple of tablespoons of ginger to the wok for each meal.

### Sauce ingredients

_These ingredients make about 4-cups, or 32oz, of sauce._

You can also add crushed red pepper flakes, to-taste, for a kick, but bear in mind that as these soak longer they
increase the heat of the sauce. In other words, _a little goes a long way_.

Generally, this amount is enough to create 9-16 servings of stir fry, or 3-4 meals for 3-4 people.

### Sauce directions

1. In a bowl, vigorously whisk the **Chicken Broth** with the **Cornstarch** until well-incorporated
2. Mix all ingredients into a sealed jar and shake well
