This is a delicious stir-fry recipe that's extremely easy to make. Once you make the sauce, you can simply chop some
vegetables and protein, which you can also do ahead of time, and have a delicious meal ready in less than 15-minutes.

Modifications from the original recipe include a reduction in ginger to better balance the sauce, and removal of red
pepper flakes by default, as the sauce is better-balanced without the extra heat. Amounts are adjusted to better fill a
32-ounce soup container for making bulk-sauce.

## Sauce recipe

You can, and should, make this sauce ahead of time. This allows the flavors to combine. Keep the sauce in the
refrigerator. It's recommended to use a soup container, or similar, with a screw-on lid for storage.

The ginger floats to the top of the sauce, so give the sauce a good shake before use to mix. Take some effort to also
not pour all the ginger into the wok, when used. Aim to add a couple of tablespoons of ginger to the wok for each meal.

### Sauce ingredients

_These ingredients make about 4-cups, or 32oz, of sauce._

|         Amount         | Ingredient                        |
| :--------------------: | :-------------------------------- |
|        1½ Cups         | Chicken Broth                     |
|         1 Cup          | Soy Sauce                         |
|     6 TBSP (⅜ Cup / 127.5g)     | Honey                             |
|     6 TBSP (⅜ Cup / 81.6g)     | Sesame Oil                        |
| 100g | Ginger, Fresh, Peeled, and Grated |
|  9 Cloves (1.5 TBSP / 28.5g)   | Garlic, Minced                    |
|         3 TBSP / 23.7g         | Cornstarch                        |

_Ginger is most-easily peeled with a spoon._

You can also add crushed red pepper flakes, to-taste, for a kick, but bear in mind that as these soak longer they
increase the heat of the sauce. In other words, _a little goes a long way_.

Generally, this amount is enough to create 9-16 servings of stir fry, or 3-4 meals for 3-4 people.

### Sauce directions

1. In a bowl, vigorously whisk the **Chicken Broth** with the **Cornstarch** until well-incorporated
2. Mix all ingredients into a sealed jar and shake well
